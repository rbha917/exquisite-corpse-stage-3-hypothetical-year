## Briefs for each stage

### 游댮 Stage 1
Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle. It does not need to follow a 24-hour cycle (you can use any timescale). Give your sketch a unique title and edit the README file accordingly.

### 游리 Stage 2
Respond to a Stage 1 sketch that you've chosen by using interactivity. You can either add to the chosen sketch or build a new one from scratch (this applies for all subsequent stages too).

### 游릭 Stage 3
Find or construct a dataset that relates to the sketch you've inherited. Incorporate visualisations of the dataset into your response to the Stage 2 sketch.

### 游댯 Stage 4
Adapt a Stage 3 sketch into a text-based game. There should be different pathways through the game. Images (still or moving) can accompany the words (but this is not required).

### 游릮 Stage 5
Reimagine something from a Stage 4 sketch as a living entity or an environment.

Welcome to this hypothetical little universe which follows a hypothetical sequence of hypothetical seasons.

I am really interested in the naturally occuring types of time - and how we tend to forget about this mesasurment of time in the overbearing presence of the man-made clock. In comparison to the ticking hands of the mechanical timepiece, the natural world around us keeps track of time in a very different way, following and changing with the path of the sun in a perpertual and fairly predictable loop.

I wanted to create a hypothetical natural loop that follows similar seasonal cycles to Earth, but on a smaller scale. There are 26 images in the changing cycle, which each represent about 14 days passing. the loop cycles through 365 days worth of seasonal changes in 26 seconds.

To create the first image I began by asking generative AI to process one single "summer" landscape. I wanted it to be as broad a promt as possible so that there would be some room for the AI to essentially make choices about what it wanted to present. Then I went into photoshop with the image and continiued to apply new generative AI fill overtop each new image and add prompts to areas such as "winter snowstorm sky" "dry barren desert" "spring flowers" "wetlands" etc. The outcome was a 26 step transformation of a single AI generated image of what it percieves as natural life. 

It took some time to blend each new image into the next and there was a lot of trial and error with what the generative fill would create. I wanted the flow of time to have some logic to it which is why it roughly follows Earth's seasonal changes.

The cycle of nature always evokes a sense of wonder, with each season of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, even each day, presenting distinctly different landscapes. Yet, we are often swept away by the torrent of time, engulfed in the ceaseless pursuits of learning and work, finding it challenging to quiet our minds and appreciate the wonders of nature. Therefore, building upon the evolving natural images created by Odette, I have integrated a time selection feature. By choosing a desired time point, the system will automatically display the corresponding natural scenery, granting us the opportunity to serenely admire the natural beauty we long for. In this way, we can momentarily detach from the busyness of reality, experiencing the slow flow of time within nature.

The program offsets the number of days in the past to match the seasonal scenery in the Northern Hemisphere.

*I thought the variety of different landscapes in this sketch to portray the different seasons was really beautiful. Inspired by this I created a dataset that observed and categorised the types of weather conditions on the first day of each month according to the previous sketch. The categories I chose to include were green indicating a lot greenery in the landscape, clouds indicating many clouds in the sky, sun representing if sunlight could be clearly seen in the sky, snow indicating the presence of snow in the landscape and dry for if the landscape appeared to be dried out. To visualise this dataset I have overlayed images of landscapes that correspond to the different categories across the months when they occurred. Their positions e.g. high or low relate to which aspect of the image they are relating to e.g. the upper images represent clouds and sun as these relate to the sky while the image for green is along running along the bottom. The dry landscape lies between both as it is also in the clouds category along with being a dry landscape. I have stretched the snow image across the length of the whole graph as it coincidentally occurred only on the first day of the first and last month in the year so I used it to build a frame around the whole piece.*
